Salam chabab,

This folder is only kept for model side, (the databases side).

WHAT A FRONT_END SHOULD DO?

Frontend a chabab khasso y assumi w ydir fdmagho ana dik data li ghatjih mn db already exist fwa7ed l file.json, matalan ila kent khdam 3la profile page, w user has 5 crucial attributes li homa
{
  id: 1
  firstName: Hicham,
  lastName: Elmefeddel,
  password: arsenal123,
  email: elmefeddelhicham@gmail.com
}

Then as a frontend khasni nkhdm f profileDemo.json w n7t fih had data bach haka tatsshal lkhedma bin 2 sides frontend and backend.

WHAT A BACKE_END SHOULD DO?

Ila kan frontend lkhedma dialo y assumi ana dik data deja kayna, fa backend lkhedma dialo hya ywjd schema li ghadii nkhdmo 3liha,w y3ti l chabab folder structure li mslka bach ykhdmo, also responsibility dial backend anaho y sawb demoFiles for frontend.

Ymkn nsawbo folder smito demo li kept only l testing w howa li frontend ghadi ytbasaw 3lih, but f production of course data ghadii tji mn db maybe f had model folder ykono 2 dbs (postgresql and neo4j) awla (mongodb and neo4j) as long as tech stack mazal mam7ddch mzn we cannot say hadi awla lakhra.

The most important thing to keep into your mind guys, howa had folder is structured as follows:
 - demo
   * profile.json
   * cities.json
   * survey.json
   ... etc (still not 100% decided which one)

 - model_1 (maybe neo4j for recommendation system)
 - model_2 (maybe mongodb or postgres for storing data)
 - Dockerfile
