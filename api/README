This folder will contain all what's necessary to manipulate the database.

However, it's the work of a backend developer to do this, for the front-end part all what they should care about is fetching data from the endpoints we'll provide them with in the api documentation.

Our api will be RESTful, no GraphQL nothing complex

to fetch user data for example just hit this endpoint: server.com/user/{userId}
to fetch city data for example just hit this endpoint: server.com/city/{cityId}

We'll document this kind of API before providing it to the frontend, therefore they can be 100% that the data they'll get is exactly what they need.

Also, the following systems logic should be provided at the api level as well:
 - RecommendatioSystem
 - DiscoverySystem
 - NearPlaces
 - PlacesSuggestion
 - RandomSuggestion
 - ... etc the more feature we can provide with good performance the better

Hopefully, this file provides a clear documenttion for what this api folder is all about
